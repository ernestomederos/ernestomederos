My name is Ernesto Mederos Garc√≠a
======================================================================================================================================

Web Developer / Former Linguist & Professor
-----------------------------------------------------

Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in the rich world of literature, exploring various literary genres, dissecting linguistic structures, and diving deep into the power of storytelling. My time at the University of Havana not only provided me with a solid foundation in these fields but also enabled me to share my knowledge and passion by teaching Spanish as a foreign language. Guiding students in their language learning journey was immensely rewarding, as I witnessed the transformative impact it had on their lives.

Seeking to complement my linguistic background with a technological edge, I embarked on a web development course at the Digital Career Institute in Berlin. This immersive experience has equipped me with practical skills in front-end and back-end web development, along with a deep understanding of modern technologies and frameworks, mainly the MERN stack. The ability to fuse my linguistic expertise with technological prowess has been instrumental in conceptualizing and developing user-centric digital solutions.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I find tremendous joy in music‚Äîa passion that fuels my creativity and complements my multidisciplinary approach. Whether it's exploring diverse genres, playing an instrument, or collaborating with fellow musicians, music has taught me the value of harmonious teamwork, discipline, and the art of expression.

As I embrace the dynamic world of technology, my true passion lies in joining creative teams and collectively building the foundation of services that make a meaningful impact on people's lives. I firmly believe in the power of technology to connect individuals, break language barriers, and foster cultural understanding. By leveraging my linguistic expertise and web development skills, I aim to contribute to innovative projects that empower individuals, amplify voices, and foster inclusive and people-centric experiences.
