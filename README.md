Web Developer | Linguist Turned Coder
-----------------------------------------------------

I took a road less traveled—diving headfirst from linguistics and literature into the cutting-edge web development realm.

I spent years dissecting the finest nuances of language at the University of Havana, teaching people to communicate across cultures. That’s where I honed the art of creating things people understand and want. I’ve supercharged that expertise with some of the most sought-after technical skills in today’s market.

👨‍💻 The Tech

MERN stack? Check. Full-stack web apps? Check. User-centric solutions that make you think, “Why didn’t anyone else take this approach?” That’s what I do. I trained at the Digital Career Institute in Berlin, mastering front-end, back-end, and everything in between, and now I’m wrapping up my freelancing project, "MEG4DEV."

🎯 The Result

I'm a developer who doesn’t just push pixels or write syntax. I bring the same obsessive attention to detail that made me a standout linguist into my coding. I focus on creating technical solutions that deliver long-term value and leverage the core strengths of any enterprise.

🎶 The Edge

What fuels my creativity? Music. Every line of code I write has its own rhythm, and much like in music, I understand the importance of collaboration, discipline, and hitting the right notes—whether it’s with a team or when crafting a seamless user experience. There's also nothing more inspiring for morning programming than a cup of black coffee and an intimate jazz playlist.

🚀 Why Should You Care?

Here’s the blunt truth: I believe opportunities don’t just come to you—you have to create them.

Do you want someone who simply writes code, or someone who transforms your project into something that truly moves people?

Your call.
